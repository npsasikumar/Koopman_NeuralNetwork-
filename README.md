This code for the article: Data-Driven Synchronization of Chaotic Nonlinear Systems via Hybrid Koopman–Neural Network Framework
This paper explores a data-driven approach to the synchronization of chaotic nonlinear systems by integrating Koopman operator theory with neural networks. Time-series data are collected from both the drive and driven systems, with the drive system’s data used to build a predictive model. The dataset is split into 80\% for training and 20\% for testing. A three-layer neural network, coupled with the Koopman operator framework, is trained to capture the system dynamics. After basic optimization, the trained model is deployed to synchronize the driven system with the drive system. The methodology is evaluated through numerical simulations on the Rössler system, implemented using Julia packages. Results indicate that the proposed Koopman-neural architecture achieves effective synchronization across a broad range of control values, validating its robustness and potential for general nonlinear system control.
